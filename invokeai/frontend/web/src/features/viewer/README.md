# Viewer

The viewer is the main panel in the `TextToImage` and `ImageToImage` tabs.

It has 3 modes:

- Image: Displays the currently selected image
- Info: Displays info for the currently selected image
- Progress: Displays generation progress, and eventually the image associated with that progress (if there was one)
